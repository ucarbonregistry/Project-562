Urjankur Shree Tatyasaheb Kore Warna Power Company Limited (Project Proponent) operates an
integrated sugar and distillery unit and has installed a 44 MW bagasse-based cogeneration plant to
meet its energy needs and supply renewable electricity to the grid. Commissioned on 22/03/2013,
the project activity utilizes bagasse—a byproduct of its sugar manufacturing—as a biomass fuel,
promoting circular economy principles and efficient resource use.
The cogeneration facility is equipped with high-pressure boilers and steam turbines. Bagasse-fired
boilers generate steam, which is used both for electricity generation and for process heating within
the sugar and distillery operations. This configuration ensures optimal energy utilization across the
integrated complex.
Out of the total installed capacity, 27.98 MW is exported to the Maharashtra State Electricity
Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) during the sugarcane crushing season, and 39.89 MW
during the off-season, under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The remaining capacity is used
for captive consumption, supporting the internal energy requirements of the plant.
